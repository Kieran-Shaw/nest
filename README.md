# NEST

NEST - or **'Nava Service Tracking'** - is a library that supports creations, changes, deletions, and updates to service plans. This is just for pure processing, not about communication with users about their actions.
___
## What are service plans?
Service plans, put simply, are templates of tasks - in a hierarchical format - that defines the likely tasks for serving that client *'The Nava Way'*. In other words, service plans are a non-exhaustive list of tasks that must be checked (TRUE or FALSE) against.

___
### **Job 1 [Create]**
* Create Service Plan

### **Job 2 [Delete]**
* Delete Service Plan

### **Job 3 [Read, Update]**
* Refactor Service Plan
    * Basically, we would want to re-build the service plan within the app, query the existing service plan from Airtable, compare the two plans together, add necessary items and then delete unnecessary items.
    * Necessary = Buckets, Milestones, & Tasks that exist in the re-built service plan but not the existing service plan.
    * Unnecessary = Buckets, Milestones, & Tasks that exist in the current service plan but not the re-built service plan.
    * **Note**: we don't want to delete the whole thing and then re-create because we do not wan't to delete all existing work.
        * ex: a service plan needs to be re-factored in the middle of a service journey. well, we don't want to delete everything that they have completed, as the service team is probably thinking about how 

### **Job 4 [Read, Update]**
* Update Changes Across Service Plan for All Created Service Plans
    * Job 1:
        * Apply new buckets / milestones / tasks to the existing service plans where applicable
            * How do we do this?
                1. Can only update by group_size at a given time (ex: Large Group)
            * Approach: do not change items that have been completed or deleted (historical), change forward looking / incomplete items only
    * Job 2:
        * Apply removed / deleted buckets / milestones / tasks to the existing service plans
            * Need to think about this one more
            * Approach: do not change items that are completed / are in the past
